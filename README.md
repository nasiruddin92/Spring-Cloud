Imagine you have a microservices-based architecture where you have multiple services, 
such as a user service, a product service, and an order service. Each of these services needs to communicate with each other.
With Eureka, you can set up a Eureka server and configure each service to register itself with the server. 
The Eureka server acts as a registry where service instances can announce their presence and provide metadata about themselves.
